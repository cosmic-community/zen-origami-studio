## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Create a serene, Japanese-inspired website that teaches origami in a tranquil, meditative way. The visual design should use soft, earthy colorsâ€”like muted greens, light beige, soft pinks, and gentle blues. The layout should be minimalist with plenty of breathing room, natural textures (like rice paper or bamboo), and subtle animations. Use elegant typography with a hand-crafted or calligraphy feel. The homepage should feature calming background musicâ€”something ambient, meditative, and optionally Japanese-influenced (koto, shakuhachi, etc.), with an easy toggle to turn sound on or off.

The site should include two main features:
	1.	Step-by-step origami tutorials with clearly labeled diagrams and smooth transitions between each fold.
	2.	A 3D interactive paper folding tool where users can manipulate a virtual piece of paper with their cursor or touch to follow along in real-time.

Include gentle animations (like floating sakura petals or a subtle paper crane glide on scroll), and a peaceful welcome message like 'Fold with intention. Learn with calm.' Build it as a single-page or minimal-page site that feels more like an experience than a tutorial site."
